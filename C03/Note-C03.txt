Chapter 3 - Adding Redux
========================
What is the best way to manage state in React.js?
It would be better to use Redux because it provides a centralised state by having restrictions to 
avoid state drilling problem and global state chaos.

The Redux Store
===============
It's using JSON format for example, user data:
{
    user: {
        isLoggedIn,
        name,
        age,
        bio
    }
}

Redux Actions
=============
It's JSON data that contains 2 things { type, payload }
Type is basically just a string naming the action.
Payload is additional data.
The purpose of redux action is to define the different events that can occur in our application.
For example:
USER_DATA_LOADED  that contains payload of UserID
ITEM_ADDED_TO_CART that contains payload of ItemID

Reducers
========
Reducers on the other hand are Redux's way of specifying what should happen in the redux store (Central State)
when a given action occurs.

Example:
When the USER_DATA_LOADED action occurs, we set the user property in the Redux store to the user data 
that's in the action payload.

When ITEM_ADDED_TO_CART occurs, we add whatever item is in the payload to the array of the array item in 
the redux store.

Overall Workflow
================
UI Triggers Action, then action is reduced to get the new updated state, 
components see READ-ONLY access to updated state.

How to install redux in your project?
E:\RMIT\Linkedin-Learning\building-modern-project-reactjs\C03\React-Ecosystems>npm install redux react-redux

$npm install redux react-redux

How to?
Step 1. Install Redux
$npm install redux react-redux

Step 2. Add store.js file and set up a basic code
==============================

import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';

const reducers = {};

// create root reducer
const rootReducer = combineReducers (reducers);

// return createStore
export const configureStore = () => createStore(rootReducer);

===============================

Step 3. Go to index.js and update the code by wrapping using the <Provider>

and import the following files.

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { configureStore  } from './store.js';

Step 4. Create redux action

Lastly, to run this application:

>npm run dev

E:\RMIT\Linkedin-Learning\building-modern-project-reactjs\C03\React-Ecosystems>npm run dev

> React-Ecosystems@1.0.0 dev E:\RMIT\Linkedin-Learning\building-modern-project-reactjs\C03\React-Ecosystems
> npx webpack-dev-server --mode development

<w> [webpack-dev-server] "hot: true" automatically applies HMR plugin, you don't have to add it manually to your webpack configuration.
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:3000/

Redux Persist
=============
This is to retain state in the browser when the user refreshes the page.

To install: npm install redux-persist

How to implement?
Step 1. go to store.js and update using the code below:

import the libraries, define persistConfig to tell where to save the state,
wrap root reducer with persistReducer function, and createStore using the persistedReducer.

--------------------------------------------------------

import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { persistReducer } from 'redux-persist';
import storage from 'redux-persist/lib/storage';
import autoMergeLevel2 from 'redux-persist/es/stateReconciler/autoMergeLevel2';
import { todos  } from './todos/reducers';

// Hook up todos with reducers
const reducers = {
    todos
};

const persistConfig = {
    key: 'root',
    storage,
    stateReconciler: autoMergeLevel2 // this is to tell Redux how to reconcile the initial and stored states of the application
};

// create root reducer
const rootReducer = combineReducers (reducers);

// persistConfig used to tell where to save the state
const persistedReducer = persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer);

// return createStore
export const configureStore = () => createStore(rootRedupersistedReducercer);

--------------------------------------------------------

Step 2. Update your index.js using below code:

Import persist libraries, define persistor variable and wrap <App /> using <PersistGate> tag

import React from 'react';
import {createRoot} from 'react-dom/client';
import { persistStore } from 'redux-persist';
import { PersistGate } from 'redux-persist/integration/react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { configureStore  } from './store.js';
import App from './App.js';

const store = configureStore();
const persistor = persistStore(store);

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(rootElement);

root.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <PersistGate 
            loading={<div>Loading...</div>}
            persistor={persistor}>
            <App />
        </PersistGate>
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
